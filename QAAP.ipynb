    "With more than 7,000 miles of tidal shoreline and sea levels that are expected to increase nearly 4â€™ by 2100, Maryland is one of the most vulnerable states to the effects of climate change. Few communities are fully prepared for the changes to come, yet coastal wetlands are known for their importance for biodiversity and as natural defenses against flooding,  storm surge, and wave attenuation. The marsh and wetland habitats along the Chesapeake Bay coast of Deal Island, Maryland has been a site of interest to help discover the value of these nature-based coastal defenses and to quantify risk reduction. Deal Island is an estuarine intertidal region within the Chesapeake Bay watershed that has been investigated as a platform to demonstrate to local decision makers the importance of adopting nature-based solutions as part of a community resilience strategy against sea level rise and storm surge."
